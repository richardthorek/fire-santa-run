name: CI - Quality Checks

# This workflow runs all quality checks for the Fire Santa Run application:
# - Linting
# - Unit tests with coverage
# - Accessibility tests
# - Build verification
#
# This replaces the separate accessibility.yml and test-coverage.yml workflows
# to avoid redundant test runs and dependency installations.
